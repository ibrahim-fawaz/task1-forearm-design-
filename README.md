MOTOR CHOOSING CRITERIA:

the motors will be choosen based on the tourqe of the motor for example,
the maximum amount of load that we need to left up is at the shoulder thus, 
the larger tourqe motor will be choosen. 

BUT, when we ONLY NEED TO ROTATE THE ARM NOT TO LEFT IT UP 
then we will choose the less toruqe motor.
